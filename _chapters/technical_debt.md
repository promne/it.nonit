Once upon a time, there was a king of a wealthy kingdom. The source of his income, the pride of a country was a beautiful bridge over a river. Solid wood, wide just enough so two horse carts could pass without bumping into each other. The region was thriving, business was good.

King has heard that the neighbouring country has a bridge as well. Nicer, apparently, with statues. So he called his architect and gave him a task to get a big statue of the queen and put it on the bridge. Made of marble, of course, to represent the royal family well. 

"My king", said the architect, "the bridge is made only of wood, this would present quite a stress on beams. I would suggest strengthening the part where you want to put the statue, or even better – build a stone pier!"  
"How much will it cost?"  
"Fifty gold coins for a wooden strengthening or two hundred for a stone pier. But with the stonework we would have to close the bridge for a week …"  
"Just put the statue there without changing a thing!"  
"As you wish, my king!"

And oh boy, what a statue that was! From close and far away people were coming to see it. King was happy, as his wealth and kingdom grew with more and more people coming.

"Architect, come here, add another statue, this time of me!", called king one day.  
"Yes my king, but the strengthening has to happen this time. Otherwise the bridge will crumble under the pressure."  
"Put there more wooden supports and let it be!"  
"My king, that will be enough for this time, barely, but I suggest to build the stone pier, that would ensure durability and even allow you to put more statues on. Maybe even widen the bridge a bit so more carts can pass!"  
"But that would mean closing the bridge, the trade would be hugely affected and so the royal treasury!"  
"Yes, but it would give you …"  
"Silence!”, the king interrupted. “I made my mind, do as I say so!"  
"I have reservations my king, but if it’s your wish, I’ll comply."

And oh boy! Two marvellous statues of king and queen looking at each other from sides of the bridge, what a sight! People from far far away were coming to see that. That attracted more merchants in turn, bringing more wealth in to the city. But it wasn’t unusual that the bridge was so full of people, that merchants started to complain crossing the bridge with their wagons is difficult.

One day the bridge collapsed. Weak support, heavy statues, many people, rotten beams. A wagon full of silk was lost with horses, some people drowned and the magnificent statues were shattered and sank.


Morale: 
* Listen to your experts. If they raise concerns and they refer to technical debt, it’s usually something you should pay attention to. 
* Trust judgement of your specialist. In the end - you do pay specialists for their expertise, so why would you ignore their assessment? Don’t think even for a second you understand what are the technical implications of your decisions. 
* If you have concerns about cost, time, present those to your specialist and discuss options. 
* Be ready that from time to time you will need to let them do things, that are not understandable to you.
* If things go down, then it affects their reputation as well, keeping things nice and working is mutually beneficial. 
* Ignorance might have fatal consequences.
