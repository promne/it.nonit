title: A book about IT for non-IT people
---

Over the years I have been asked many times “Hey, what are you actually doing?”. The easy answer, that I am a software engineer and I usually do make a custom software, is not exactly captivating nor descriptive enough. 

And if I get into the nitty-gritty details (which I enjoy very much), I can see the blank stare settling in the eyes of a person that dared to ask, already feeling sorry for raising that stupid question. The stream of words and abbreviations that scratch in the throat when you try to pronounce them, usually consisting of 3 to 7 letters reminds parlance of a member of a witchcraft circle more than common human language.

It’s not easy. Striking the balance between descriptive enough and not too cryptic.

Communication is crucial.

But even inside of the industry, there are many people who have no idea, how some things work. I got it, why should they – it’s my bread and butter to understand how computer works. Not theirs. How can we find a common ground to discuss problems and reach solutions? How to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical worlds?

You know how this work:
BA: Hey, I think we should tweak the flubbers so customer gets the report quicker.
IT: What?
BA: You know, flubbers ... increase maybe ..?
IT: No .. please stop ...
BA: Flub...
IT: There is no such thing and you have obviously no idea how computer works! If you even try to suggest anything else, I truly believe the whole thing will burst into flames ... go away ...

(note: BA stands for a business analyst)

So yeah ... I had a fair share of discussions with mostly BAs, about how to do things. If it’s not obvious, I’ll be railing BA people quite a lot. 

I am really good at bad analogies. So I thought: „Hmm, what if I help those poor people and write a book, that would help them? Something like allegories, short stories, maybe with cute pictures, like children books have, so those poor poor BAs get at least a hint of what is actually happening?“. And here we are. 

Let me present to you a collection of short stories and kind of a dictionary that in theory, could help you understand what the hack I am actually doing and why I am usually angry.
